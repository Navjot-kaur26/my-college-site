      <h2>📘 Our Story</h2>
      <p>
        NotesNest began as a solution to a common student problem: scattered and unreliable notes. During exam time, we spent more time searching than studying.
      </p>
      <p>
        So we built NotesNest — a hub for semester-wise, clean, and clear notes. A space that makes learning efficient, not exhausting.
      </p>
      <p>
        Created by students, for students, NotesNest has grown from a small idea into a platform trusted by thousands. Our goal is to simplify learning with organized resources that actually help.
